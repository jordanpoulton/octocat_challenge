A 'branch' allows you to make changes to the code without affecting other 'branches'. Once you have made a branch, you can make changes to it and commit those changes within your own, sandboxed workflow. Only when you are ready can you 'merge' this branch back into the 'master' branch. This allows many people to work on the same piece of code without having to wait for each other to keep up, and without having to do it in a specific order, as you might in the real world. To use an analogy, in the real world, you can't start working on the roof of a house until the walls are built. In code, you could make a 'roof' branch, and could work on it AT THE SAME TIME as another group was working on the walls, and the two could be merged when they were ready, thus greatly accelerating development.
