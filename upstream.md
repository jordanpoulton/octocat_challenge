The 'upstream' remote is used for keeping up to date records of a remote that you have forked. When you fork it, you take it in your own, new direction, and it isn't in your interest to push/pull to the original as your code will diverge from the original. You might, however, like to keep it synched with the latest version of the original code in case you ever wanted to merge the two. You therefore create a 'upstream' remote, so that you can pull the latest changes of the original code to your upstream remote, while keeping your origin seperate and unaffected by changes in the code that you originally forked.
